# cursor-demo

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how software engineers can effectively utilize Cursor with Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in their regular development workflow. This demo showcases the integration of Cursor, an AI-powered coding assistant, to streamline and enhance various aspects of software development, including code generation, refactoring, and documentation.

By leveraging Cursor with SOPs, developers can:

-   Accelerate their coding process
-   Maintain consistency in code style and structure
-   Easily implement best practices and design patterns
-   Improve code quality and readability
-   Streamline collaboration among team members

This project serves as a practical example of how AI-assisted development can be seamlessly incorporated into existing workflows, potentially boosting productivity and code quality across software engineering teams.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/cursor-demo.git
cd cursor-demo  `

2. Install dependencies: `npm install  `

3. Set up environment variables:

    - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
    - Update the variables in `.env` as needed

4. Start the development server: `npm run dev  `
